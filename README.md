# FireGuard: Autonomous Fire Detection and Extinguishing System

## Overview

FireGuard is an advanced autonomous fire detection and extinguishing system designed to detect fires in multiple rooms, alert authorities, and deploy a robot to extinguish the fire. The system is divided into two main sections:

* **Section A (Control Unit)**: Responsible for fire detection, user interface, communication, and audio announcements. It uses an ESP32 to monitor fire sensors, display system status on a TFT screen, make phone calls via a SIM800L module, and play audio announcements using a DFPlayer Mini.
* **Section B (Firefighting Robot)**: A mobile robot that navigates to the fire location using RFID tags and IR sensors, communicates with Section A via ESP-NOW, and extinguishes fires using a water pump.

The system operates in a multi-room environment (Room 11, 12, 30, 31, and a refill station), providing a smart solution for fire safety.

## Features

* **Fire Detection**: Detects fires in four rooms (Room 11, 12, 30, 31) using flame sensors.
* **User Interface**: Displays system status (battery, water level, fire status) on an Adafruit ST7735 TFT display.
* **Phone Number Editing**: Allows users to edit owner and emergency numbers using a keypad with the secret code `*153#`.
* **Audio Announcements**: Plays pre-recorded messages for the owner and fire service using a DFPlayer Mini module.
* **Automated Alerts**: Automatically calls the owner and fire service via a SIM800L module when a fire is detected.
* **Robot Navigation**: Navigates to the fire location using RFID tags for room identification and IR sensors for line following.
* **ESP-NOW Communication**: Sections A and B communicate wirelessly using ESP-NOW to coordinate fire detection and response.
* **Fire Extinguishing**: The robot uses a water pump to extinguish fires and returns to the refill station (Room 0) after the task.

## System Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Section A (Control Unit)**:

   * Monitors fire sensors in four rooms.
   * Displays system status on a TFT screen.
   * Allows phone number editing via a 4x4 keypad.
   * Makes calls to the owner and fire service using a SIM800L module.
   * Plays audio announcements using a DFPlayer Mini.
   * Communicates with Section B via ESP-NOW.

2. **Section B (Firefighting Robot)**:

   * Receives fire detection commands from Section A via ESP-NOW.
   * Navigates to the target room using RFID tags and IR sensors.
   * Extinguishes the fire using a water pump.
   * Sends status updates (water level, fire status, robot state) back to Section A.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zibontaroka/FireGuard.git
   ```

2. **Install Arduino IDE and Libraries**:

   * Install the Arduino IDE and add ESP32 board support.
   * Install the required libraries via the Arduino Library Manager.

3. **Set Up Hardware**:

   * Connect the components for Section A and Section B as per the pin configuration tables.
   * Ensure the 18650 battery packs are charged and connected.

4. **Configure ESP-NOW**:

   * Update the MAC addresses in ESPNowCommA.h and ESPNowCommB.h to match your ESP32 devices.

     * Section A MAC Address (in ESPNowCommB.h): `{0x94, 0x54, 0xC5, 0xA8, 0x3D, 0x04}`
     * Section B MAC Address (in ESPNowCommA.h): `{0x94, 0x54, 0xC5, 0xA8, 0x3D, 0x04}`
   * Replace these with the actual MAC addresses of your ESP32 boards. To find the MAC address, upload a simple sketch to print it to the Serial Monitor.

5. **Upload the Code**:

   * Open `FireGuard_SectionA.ino` in the Arduino IDE and upload it to the Section A ESP32.
   * Open `FireGuard_SectionB.ino` in the Arduino IDE and upload it to the Section B ESP32.

## Usage

1. **Power On the System**:

   * Power on both Section A (Control Unit) and Section B (Robot) using the 18650 battery packs.

2. **Monitor System Status**:

   * Section A will display the system status on the TFT screen, including:

     * Battery percentage
     * Water level percentage
     * Fire status (ON/OFF)
     * Current mode, room, last event, GSM, ESP, and DFP status
     * Owner and emergency phone numbers

3. **Edit Phone Numbers**:

   * Enter the secret code `*153#` on the keypad to access the phone number editor.
   * Press `A` to edit the owner number or `B` to edit the emergency number.
   * Use the keypad to input the new number: `*` to save, `#` to cancel, `D` to delete digits.

4. **Respond to Fire**:

   * When fire is detected:

     * Section A calls the owner and fire service, plays audio via DFPlayer.
     * Section B navigates to the detected room and extinguishes the fire.
     * After extinguishing, Section B returns to Room 0 (refill station).
